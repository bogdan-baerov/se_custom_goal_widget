I used the custom code & documentation from here, and then I updated and made my own:
https://github.com/StreamElements/widgets/blob/master/CustomCode.md

The widget has customizable fields, and can be edited as you wish by using the fields in the widget.

Usage:
- Create or open an existent StreamElements Scene;
- Click on the +, select "Static / Custom", then "Custom Widget";
- Click on "Open Editor" on the sidebar in the left;
- Copy paste the code in each file in their own tab:
    o code.html goes in the "HTML" tab;
    o code.css goes in the "CSS" tab;
    o code.js goes in the "JS" tab;
    o code.json goes in the "FIELDS" tab;
- Customize as you wish.
